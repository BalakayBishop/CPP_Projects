/*
 * Procedural Programming
 *      the fucos is the function, creating functions
 *      data is declared separately
 *      data is passed as arguments into functions
 *      
 * Object-Oriented Programming
 *      all about modeling in terms of classes and objects 
 * 
 * Encapsulation - an abstract data type 
 * 
 * Information hiding - hiding implementation-specific logic 
 *      
 * All about reusability 
 *      faster development 
 *      higher quality 
 * 
 * Inheritence 
 *      can create new classes in term of existing classes
 *      polymorphic classes 
 * 
 * Classes 
 *      blueprint for which objects are created 
 *      user-defined data-type 
 *      attribtues (data)
 *      functions (methods)
 *      can hide data and methods via private and public keywords
 *      Example: Account, employee, vector, string
 * Objects
 *      created from classes
 *      a specific instance of a class 
 *      can have as many objects as needed
 *      each obj has its own idenity
 *      Example : Account frank_account; an object named frank_account of class Account
 *
