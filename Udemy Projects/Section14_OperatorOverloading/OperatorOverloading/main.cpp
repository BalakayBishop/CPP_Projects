/* 
 * Operator Overloading
 *      overload most operators to work with user defined classes
 *      assignment operator - default assignment
 *      overload as member and global function 
 *      we can also overload << and >> 
 * 
 * Allows user defined type to behave similar to built-in types 
 * Can make code more readable
 * All other overlaoding other than = must be done explicitly
 * Function example: result = multiply(add(a,b), divide(c,d));
 * Method example: result = (a.add(b)).multiply(c.divide(d));
 * 
 * Cannot be overloaded
 *      ::, :?, .*, ., and sizeof
 * 
 * precendence and associativity cannot be changed 
 * arity cannot be changed
 * cannot overload operators for primitive types 
 * cannot creat new coperators
 *
